# Specify the port for SSH. Change this to a non-standard port to reduce exposure to automated scans.
Port 6594

# Protocol versions to support. Disable SSH Protocol 1 for security reasons.
# Ensure SSH server only uses SSH protocol version 2
# SSHv1 contains security issues and should be avoided at all costs
# Although SSHv1 is disabled by default after OpenSSH 7.0, this option is specified to ensure compatibility with older versions of OpenSSH server

Protocol 2

# Disable root login via SSH to prevent direct root access.
PermitRootLogin no

# Disable tun device forwarding
PermitTunnel no

# Override default of no subsystems
# Path to the sftp-server binary depends on your distribution
# Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server
# Subsystem sftp /usr/libexec/openssh/sftp-server
Subsystem sftp internal-sftp

# Disable password-based authentication in favor of SSH key-based authentication.
PasswordAuthentication no

# PAM authentication enabled to make password authentication available
# remove this if password authentication is not needed
# UsePAM yes

# Set the maximum idle time in seconds before a session is terminated
ClientAliveInterval 180
# NUMBER OF CLIENT ALIVE MESSAGES SENT WITHOUT CLIENT RESPONDING
ClientAliveCountMax 2

# Prevent remote hosts from connecting to forwarded ports
# Forwarded ports are forced to bind to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0
GatewayPorts no



# This setting disables all forwarding features in SSH, overriding any other forwarding switches.
# Setting DisableForwarding to 'yes' ensures that no forwarding is permitted, including TCP, StreamLocal, and tun device forwarding.
DisableForwarding yes


# Specify the path to the authorized keys file. This is where SSH public keys for authentication are stored.
AuthorizedKeysFile      .ssh/authorized_keys .ssh/authorized_keys2

# Limit SSH access to specific users or groups, if applicable.
AllowUsers lalatendu

# To prevent StreamLocal (Unix-domain socket) forwarding in your SSH configuration, use the following directive
AllowStreamLocalForwarding no

# Specify the list of ciphers and MAC algorithms to use. This can enhance security by disabling weaker Cryptography algorithms.
Ciphers aes256-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr,chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com
MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com

# Limit the maximum number of authentication attempts per connection to mitigate brute-force attacks.

# Disable empty passwords.

StrictModes yes

# Disable X11 forwarding to prevent X11 GUI applications from being forwarded over SSH.
X11Forwarding no

# Disallow TCP port forwarding over SSH tunnels
# Note: Disabling TCP forwarding does not prevent users from creating port forwarding via other means
# Users with interactive login shell privileges can still establish their own SSH tunnels
AllowTcpForwarding no

# Enable strict mode for enhanced security

# PREVENT SSH TRUST RELATIONSHIPS FROM ALLOWING LATERAL MOVEMENTS
IgnoreRhosts yes

# Log SSH environment variables for auditing

# Enable compression for faster data transfer over SSH.
# Compression yes

# COMPRESSION BEFORE ENCRYPTION MIGHT CAUSE SECURITY ISSUES
Compression no

# Set the logging level for SSH connections. Adjust as needed for your logging requirements.
